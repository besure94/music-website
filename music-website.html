		<h3>My music project</h3>
		<p>Since I love music so much, I also create my own music! I would describe it as acoustic punk with folk elements, or folk punk for short.</p>
		<h4>What the heck is folk punk, anyway?</h4>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_punk">Folk punk</a> (known in its early days as rogue folk) is a fusion of folk music and punk rock. It was popularized in the early 1980s by the Pogues in England, and by Violent Femmes in the United States. Folk punk achieved some mainstream success in that decade. In more recent years, its subgenres Celtic punk and Gypsy punk have experienced some commercial success.</p>
