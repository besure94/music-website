#### By Brian Scherner

#### A website demonstrating knowledge and application of HTML and CSS.

## Technologies used

## Description

This website allows users to read about my musical interests and explore some of my favorite genres and artists. Users can also navigate to another website that showcases my own musical project, Sins N Grins.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the first HTML file in the directory.
* Open music-website.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs
